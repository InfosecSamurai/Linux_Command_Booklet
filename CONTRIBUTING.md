### 3. **Repository Configuration**
Ensure the file is properly recognized by GitHub. Sometimes, moving the file into the `.github` directory might help.

### 4. **Browser Cache**
Clear your browser cache or try viewing the file in a different browser to ensure you’re seeing the most up-to-date version.

### 5. **GitHub Rendering**
GitHub sometimes takes a moment to render changes in Markdown files. Wait a few moments and refresh the page.

If all these steps are followed correctly, your `CONTRIBUTING.md` should render properly in GitHub's preview. If you’re still facing issues, feel free to reach out for more detailed troubleshooting.
