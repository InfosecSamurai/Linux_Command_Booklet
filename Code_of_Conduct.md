# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment
We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all contributors, regardless of their experience level, background, or identity. We strongly value diversity and strive to ensure that every participant feels respected and included.

## Expected Behavior
We expect all contributors to:
- Be respectful and constructive in discussions and feedback.
- Use inclusive language that acknowledges the diversity of the community.
- Be open to collaboration and be willing to listen to othersâ€™ ideas and perspectives.
- Provide constructive criticism that is focused on the work and not the individual.
- Be considerate of the time and effort that others contribute to the project.

## Unacceptable Behavior
Examples of unacceptable behavior include, but are not limited to:
- Harassment, bullying, or intimidation of any kind.
- Discriminatory remarks or actions based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or religion.
- Personal attacks, trolling, or inflammatory comments.
- Inappropriate communication in any form, including online and offline.

## Reporting Issues
If you witness or experience unacceptable behavior, or have concerns about the conduct of any participant, please report it by:
1. **Emailing**: InfosecSamurai@onmail.com
2. **Opening an Issue**: On the issue tracker of the repository, please provide as much context as possible.

All reports will be treated with respect and confidentiality.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
Participants asked to stop any unacceptable behavior are expected to comply immediately. If the behavior continues, the project maintainers may take further action, including warning the offender or banning them from the project.

## Acknowledgments
This Code of Conduct is inspired by the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), which aims to provide a unified, community-based standard for fostering a positive environment for open source projects.

## Changes
We may update this Code of Conduct from time to time to reflect changes in the project and community expectations.
